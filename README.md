# Values Cryptography (Variants of Vigenère cipher)

This cryptography project aims to show how Vigenère cipher works.
In order to use the files, follow these steps:
1)	Download “main crypto.c” and “fonctions crypto.c” in order to compile in C IDE.
2)	Start the main and obtain your encrypted code.
3)	Through the “main decrypto.c” and “fonctions decrypto.c”, you can convert the encrypted message in the original one.
